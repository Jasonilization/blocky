# Wrapper around `swift build` that pins the macOS 26.5 SDK when building with
# Command Line Tools only. Rationale: the macOS 27 SDK re-implements SwiftUI's
# @State as a macro whose plugin (libSwiftUIMacros.dylib) ships with Xcode but
# not with CLT. Building against the 26.5 SDK (deployment target stays 13.0)
# keeps plain `swift build` working on CLT-only machines; on machines with
# full Xcode the default SDK already resolves this, so no pinning is applied.
